# Advanced Mappings: Spring Data JPA - Hibernate
**1.** For each of the following mappings, make sure you run the corresponding SQL scripts on a MySQL DBMS, before running each Spring application.
   SQL scripts are located inside the "sql_files_for_mysql" folder.
- **One-to-one unidirectional:**
  * Spring project folder: 1-jpa-one-to-one-unidirectional
  * SQL script folder: 1-one-to-one-unidirectional
- **One-to-one bidirectional:**
  * Spring project folder: 2-jpa-one-to-one-bidirectional
  * SQL script folder: 2-one-to-one-bidirectional
- **One-to-many:**
  * Spring project folder: 3-jpa-one-to-many
  * SQL script folder: 3-one-to-many
- **One-to-many unidirectional:**
  * Spring project folder: 4-jpa-one-to-many-unidirectional
  * SQL script folder: 4-one-to-many-unidirectional
- **Many-to-many:**
  * Spring project folder: 5-jpa-many-to-many
  * SQL script folder: 5-many-to-many

**2.** VERY IMPORTANT: In any of the Spring projects, MAKE SURE TO CHANGE the username and password in the "application.properties" files to the username/password you used to log into your MySQL DB instance. You might also remember to update the database URL accordingly.
